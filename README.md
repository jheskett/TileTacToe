# TileTacToe
Windows WPF program to play 4x4x4 Tic Tac Toe

This was the final project for my C# class at UMA in 2017. It's a colorful Tic Tac Toe variant on a "3D" board with sound and animation.

It also features a rather challenging AI. There are 76 winning lines in a 4x4x4 board. The AI sorts these lines by the best chances for a win, discarding lines where the opponent has placed a tile, and raising those where the opponent is building a line or the AI has an opportunity to build a line.

Some screenshots are below:
